Progress on my dissertation on the Rigidity of circle packings formed from minimally rigid graphs has been committed here regularly throughout the academic year 2023-2024. I have written two modules, Rigidity.py and Circle_Packing.py, to find circle packings arising from minimally rigid graphs that are infinitesimally rigid. This is evaluated in the script Rigid_Packings.py.

The algorithm implemented to do this can be found in the file Write-up/Dissertation.pdf on page 45 under 'Algorithm 4.2'.
